Release 1.1.1 (2015-12-03)
==========================
	
	- Definition of new statements equivalent to the parallel postulate and related proofs.
	- Algebraic characterization of right triangle, parallelism and perpendicularity using coordinates.
	- The Gröbner basis method can now be used to prove statements within Tarski's system of geometry.

Release 1.1.0 (2015-10-27)
==========================
	
	- Reorganization of files into directories.
	- Creation of a ./configure.
	- Formalization of Chapter 16 of SST:
	  definition of coordinates and characterization of Cong and Bet using coordinates.
	- Algebraic characterization of Midpoint and Col using coordinates.
	- Proof of the equivalence between upper-dimension axiom and the fact that all points are coplanar.
	- Proof of the pseudo-transitivity and permutation properties of the generalized con-cyclic predicate.
	- Definition of the sum of angles and related proofs.
	- Proofs about the parallel postulate:
	  assuming a weak geometric version of Archimedes axiom, 
	  the fact that the sum of angles of a triangle is two rights implies Playfair's postulate.
	- Proofs of the decidability of Chapter 11 predicates, assuming points equality decidability.
