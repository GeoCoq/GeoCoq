Release 2.4.0
==========================

	- Introduction of several packages: "coinc" includes some useful tactics we developed, "axioms" all our axiom systems, 
	  "elements" the formalization of Euclid's proofs, "pof" the plane over a real closed field modeling Tarski's axioms,
	  and "main" the rest of the development.
	- This release is compatible with Coq 8.6.1, 8.7.2, 8.8. Some files depends on mathcomp field library (version >=1.6.4). Mathcomp is used only to build a model of the axioms, it is not essential for using the library.
	- Reorganization of the type classes to allow more different contexts.
	- Definition of Hilbert's line completeness axiom and two versions of Hilbert's completeness axiom.
	- Proof that Hilbert's line completeness axiom implies Hilbert's completeness axiom.
	- Proof that Dedekind cut axiom implies Hilbert's line completeness axiom.
	- Add two versions of the circle-circle continuity and the equivalence proofs.
	- Most of the development in neutral geometry is now dimensionless, including the equivalence of the different versions of the parallel postulate.
	- Add some definitions and properties about planes.
	- Definition of five equivalent versions of the upper 3-dimensional axiom and related proofs.
	- The fixed axioms of Euclid's Elements is modified to be closer to Euclid's. Proofs for Book I are updated accordingly.
	- Add constructions for parallelogram and rhombus (by R. Coghetto)
	- Model of Tarski's axioms: a cartesian plane over a real closed field: this part of the development depends on mathcomp library.

Release 2.3.0
==========================

	- This release is compatible with Coq 8.5, 8.6 and trunk.
	- Definition of the sum of segments and related proofs.
	- Files grouping Euclid's Elements Propositions for which we have a proof based on Tarski's axioms: Book I Prop. 1-34 and 46-47, Book III Prop. 2-14 17-18.
	- Definitions of an axiom system to prove Propositions of Euclid's Elements and some links with Tarski's axiom system.
	- Coq translation of Michael Beeson's formalization of the 48 propositions of Book 1 of Euclid's Elements, those proofs try to mimic Euclid's proofs as much as possible but are based on a richer axiom system than Tarski's.
	- Definition of elementary continuity properties: segment-circle, line-circle, circle-circle continuity properties.
	- Definition of first-order Dedekind cut axiom, and Dedekind cut axiom.
	- Proof that Archimedes' axiom can be derived from Dedekind cut axiom.
	- Proof of the equivalence between different variants of circle-circle continuity.
	- Proof of the equivalence between different variants of line-circle, and segment-circle continuity.
	- Proof that line-circle continuity can be derived from circle-circle continuity.
	- Proof that circle-circle continuity can be derived from first-order Dedekind cut axiom.
	- Add a new version of the parallel postulate and the equivalence proofs.
	- Add definitions of predicates to express that a point is inside, on and outside a circle, and associated lemmas.
	- Add some properties about tangency.
	- Add some results about half of angles.

	  the altitude from vertex A is also the angle bisector from vertex A and the median from vertex A.

	- The TS Predicate (Two Sides) was cleared of a redundant condition.
	- Definition of the interior bisector and related properties.
	- Proof of the existence of the incenter of a triangle.
	- Proof of the existence of an equilateral triangle build on a given base without any continuity axiom (in any Pythagorean field).
	- Justification of the axioms of the area method.

==========================

	- Definition of new statements equivalent to the parallel postulate and related proofs.
	- Algebraic characterization of right triangle, parallelism and perpendicularity using coordinates.

==========================

	- Reorganization of files into directories.
	- Creation of a ./configure.

	- Definition of the sum of angles and related proofs.
	- Definition of a weak geometric version of Archimedes' axiom: Aristotle's axiom.
	- Proofs about the parallel postulate:
	  assuming Aristotle's axiom,
	  the fact that the angles of a triangle sum to exactly two right angles implies Playfair's postulate.
	- Proofs of the decidability of the predicates from Chapter 11, assuming point equality decidability.
