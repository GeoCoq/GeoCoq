Release 2.3.0
==========================

	- This release is compatible with Coq 8.5 8.6 and trunk.
	- Definition of the sum of segments and related proofs.

	- Proof that Archimedes axiom can be derived from Dedekind axiom.
	- Proof of the equivalence between different variants of circle-circle continuity.
	- Proof of the equivalence between different variants of line-circle, and segment-circle continuity.
	- Proof that line-circle continuity can be derived from circle-circle continuity.
	- Proof that circle-circle continuity can be derived from first-order Dedekind cuts.
	- Add a new version of the parallel postulate and the equivalence proofs.
	- Add definitions of predicate to express that a point is inside, on and outside a circle, and associated lemmas.
	- Add some properties about tangency.
	- Add some results about half of angles.

Release 2.2.1
==========================

	- Add compatibility with Coq 8.6.

	- Definition of Archimedes' postulate (geometric version).
	- Archimedes postulate for angles.
	- Archimedes postulate implies Aristotle postulate.
	- Legendre's theorems.
	- Predicate TS (Two Sides) cleared of a redundant condition.
	- Definition of the interior bisector and related properties.
	- Existence of the incenter of a triangle.
	- Proof of the existence of an equilateral triangle build on a given base without any continuity axiom (in any Pythagorean field).
	- Justification of the axioms of the area method.

Release 2.1.1 (2016-05-25)

	- Definition of new statements equivalent to the parallel postulate and related proofs.

Release 2.0.0 (2016-03-03)
==========================

	This version does not bring many new results but we cleaned up the names of the definitions.

	- Definition of new statements equivalent to the parallel postulate and related proofs.
	- Many predicates renamed.

Release 1.1.1 (2015-12-03)
==========================

	- Definition of new statements equivalent to the parallel postulate and related proofs.
	- Algebraic characterization of right triangle, parallelism and perpendicularity using coordinates.

Release 1.1.0 (2015-10-27)
==========================

	- Reorganization of files into directories.
	- Creation of a ./configure.
	- Formalization of Chapter 16 of SST:
	  definition of coordinates and characterization of Cong and Bet using coordinates.
	- Algebraic characterization of Midpoint and Col using coordinates.
	- Proof of the equivalence between upper-dimension axiom and the fact that all points are coplanar.
	- Proof of the pseudo-transitivity and permutation properties of the generalized con-cyclic predicate.
	- Definition of the sum of angles and related proofs.
	- Proofs about the parallel postulate:
	  assuming a weak geometric version of Archimedes axiom, 
	  the fact that the sum of angles of a triangle is two rights implies Playfair's postulate.
	- Proofs of the decidability of Chapter 11 predicates, assuming points equality decidability.
