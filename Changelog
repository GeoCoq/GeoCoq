Release 2.5.0
==========================
        - This release is compatible, at the moment of the release, with Coq 8.10.0-8.19.1. Some files depends on mathcomp field library (1.11.0 <= version <= 1.19.0).
	- Reorganization of files into directories that match the various subpackages of GeoCoq.
	- Add the possibility to build with dune. This requires dune >= 3.8 so it is only compatible with Coq > 8.13.
	- While the compilation time of the library decreased thanks to some performance improvements made by Coq, we also made GeoCoq compile faster.
        - We formalized ten out of the eleven counter-models for planar geometry present in Gupta's thesis. For a few of them we did not yet mechanize the proof that the continuity axiom holds.
        - We defined an alternative axiom system that, we believe, allows to obtain the arithmetization of n-dimensional geometry without relying on decidability properties.
        - We formalized counter-models for this system, either by generalizing Gupta's ones or by inventing new ones. Up to the mechanization of the proofs that the proposed dimensional axioms hold in some counter-models, we have the same results as for planar geometry.

Release 2.4.1
==========================
	- This release is compatible with Coq 8.7.0-8.11.2. Some files depends on mathcomp field library (1.6.4 <= version < 1.11.0).
	- Add compatibility with Coq 8.10-11.
	- Proof that Greenberg's axiom implies Aristotle's axiom.
	- Proof that the conjunction of Archimedes' axiom and Cantor's nested intervals axiom implies Dedekind cut axiom.
	- Proof that Cantor's nested intervals axiom implies Archimedes' axiom.
	- Definition of a reflexive tactic for Cong : CongR.

Release 2.4.0
==========================

	- This release is compatible with Coq 8.6.1, 8.7.2, 8.8. Some files depends on mathcomp field library (version >=1.6.4).
	  Mathcomp is used only to build a model of the axioms, it is not essential for using the library.
	- Introduction of several packages: "coinc" includes some useful tactics we developed, "axioms" all our axiom systems,
	  "elements" the formalization of Euclid's proofs, "pof" the plane over a real closed field modeling Tarski's axioms,
	  and "main" the rest of the development.
	- Reorganization of the type classes to allow more different contexts.
	- Definition of Hilbert's line completeness axiom and two versions of Hilbert's completeness axiom.
	- Proof that Hilbert's line completeness axiom implies Hilbert's completeness axiom.
	- Proof that Dedekind cut axiom implies Hilbert's line completeness axiom.
	- Add two versions of the circle-circle continuity and the equivalence proofs.
	- Most of the development in neutral geometry is now dimensionless, including the equivalence of the different versions of the parallel postulate.
	- Add some definitions and properties about planes.
	- Definition of five equivalent versions of the upper 3-dimensional axiom and related proofs.
	- The fixed axioms of Euclid's Elements is modified to be closer to Euclid's. Proofs for Book I are updated accordingly.
	- Add constructions for parallelogram and rhombus (by R. Coghetto).
	- Model of Tarski's axioms: a cartesian plane over a real closed field: this part of the development depends on the Mathematical Components Library.

==========================

	- This release is compatible with Coq 8.5, 8.6 and trunk.
	- Definition of the sum of segments and related proofs.

	- Definitions of an axiom system to prove Propositions of Euclid's Elements and some links with Tarski's axiom system.
	- Coq translation of Michael Beeson's formalization of the 48 propositions of Book 1 of Euclid's Elements, those proofs try to mimic Euclid's proofs as much as possible but are based on a richer axiom system than Tarski's.
	- Definition of elementary continuity properties: segment-circle, line-circle, circle-circle continuity properties.
	- Definition of first-order Dedekind cut axiom, and Dedekind cut axiom.
	- Proof that Archimedes' axiom can be derived from Dedekind cut axiom.
